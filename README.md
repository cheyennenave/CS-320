Software Testing and Automation

//How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
// To ensure secure and functional code, I test from the start of software development. This will uncover missed bugs at the beginning as well as uncover issues that may not have been foreseen during the planning stage of the SDLC. Also, I like to use modular code that can be reusable. This prevents excess coding and keeps the program clean.
//How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
// I look over project details and create a separate list based and ranked on importance of each item that the client is needed. This ensures that all requirements are met and if there are any miscommunications, I can directly reference which item in the list harbors any confusion. This helps me to build a working project that meets all necessities that the client requires.
//How do I approach designing software?
//I like to look over project documents and find what the purpose of the project is, what the client would want to have and what the client needs to have. I create a list of importance which ranks each want and need, then I create a Gantt chart to help pace out the project. For this project, I built one service and test each week which kept me on pace to submit with low stress by the time the due date rolled around. This includes other assignments I was involved in during those same weeks as well. As I code, I test and uncover bugs, then continue in a cyclical manner until the program works and the work is submitted.
